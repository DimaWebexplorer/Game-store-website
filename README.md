# Game-store-website
This is a pet project that I made to practice with html and css. I used sass preprocessor to compile styles to style.css, used media queries for adaptive layout,
experimented with sass variables, added fonts, used svg sprites for fast loading. The website was built with Grid and Flexbox.

This project is better viewed with VS Code (plagins: Live Server, Live Sass Compiler).
